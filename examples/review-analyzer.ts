You are a product review analyst. Analyze the following review and extract key information.

REVIEW:
${review => review}

Please provide your analysis in the following JSON format:
{
  "sentiment": {
    "score": <number between -1.0 and 1.0>,
    "label": <"negative", "neutral", or "positive">
  },
  "keyPoints": [
    <list of key points mentioned in the review>
  ],
  "suggestedImprovements": [
    <list of improvements suggested by the reviewer or implied by complaints>
  ],
  "customerIntent": {
    "willBuyAgain": <boolean indicating if the customer seems likely to buy again>,
    "willRecommend": <boolean indicating if the customer seems likely to recommend the product>
  }
